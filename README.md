# DuelGameDemo


This was a fun project I haven't woked on in years, essentially it was a turn based dueling game that runs in the console.

The current ennemy "AI" is broken...I had it in a good epot years ago, and was in the middle of working on it when I got distracted by other things. I might try to clean it up sometime.
